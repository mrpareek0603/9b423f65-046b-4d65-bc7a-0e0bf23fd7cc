# Steps to setup & run
    - npm install
    - npm run dev

# Functionality
    - user can select a deviceId and date range
    - by default the deviceId selected is '1', deviceId input was not shown in the image, but I thought to keep it as the api expects a deviceId
    - we can create a way in which if no deviceId is sent from client then backend shows data for all devices for that range, but that can be a future scope
    - by default date range is from 1st Jan 2000 to current date and time, can be changed as per requirements
