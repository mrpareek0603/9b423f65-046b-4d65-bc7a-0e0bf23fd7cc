# Savings Tracker app by Rohan :D

# Technology used:
    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - React.js

# Note:
    - I created the frontend  using reacta s i have some experience in it, but I alos took a look at how things work in Vue.js, and I must say the syntax is cleaner in Vue.
    - I will rampup on Vue before joining the company and start working on it as soon as I join.

## Backend

cd backend
npm install
